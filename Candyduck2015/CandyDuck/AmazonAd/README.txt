KNOWN ISSUES
* During integration and testing of the Amazon Mobile Ads SDK, you should set the 
  testRequest option to true. This indicates that the request is for testing. Test 
  requests will not show up in your metrics. Test traffic that doesnâ€™t include 
  this flag can result in blocked requests, fraud investigation, and potential 
  account termination. Each loadAd call requires an instance of an AmazonAdOptions 
  class. Set the testRequest property to YES to enable test requests. For example:

    AmazonAdOptions *options = [AmazonAdOptions options];
    adOptions.isTestRequest = YES;
   [amazonAdView loadAd:options];
